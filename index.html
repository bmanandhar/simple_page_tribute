            Siddhartha Gautama, after enlightenment
          </div>
        <h3>Here is the story how Gautama becomes the buddha</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Birth</strong>
              <p>Twenty-five centuries ago, King Suddhodana ruled a land near the Himalaya Mountains.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Early Life</strong>
            <p>Siddhartha was also known in history by the name Gautama. This was in fact his family name, which he inherited from his mother's side</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Path to Enlightenment</strong>
              <p>Shortly afterwards, one day, in the middle of the night, when every one was asleep, he left the palace, his family, friends and the kingdom</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Basic Teacing</strong>
              <p>After his enlightenment, he went to the Deer Park near the holy city of Benares and shared his new understanding with five holy men. They understood immediately and became his disciples. This marked the beginning of the Buddhist community.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
  <blockquote>
  <p>"Today, Buddhism appeals to the West because it has no dogmas, and it satisfies both the reason and the heart alike. It insists on self-reliance coupled with tolerance for others. It embraces modern scientific discoveries if they are for constructive purposes. Buddhism points to man alone as the creator of his present life and as the sole designer of his own destiny. Such is the nature of Buddhism. This is why many modern thinkers who are not themselves Buddhist have described Buddhism as a religion of freedom and reason."</p>
